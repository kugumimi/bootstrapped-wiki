It is so very, very cold. The frigidity of the blank uncaring void is enveloping and deserting. It haunts you. 

But, there isn’t a “you” to gesture at, is there? 

Thoughtless molecules drift by in feigned stagnancy toward the Vantablack nothing. There is no metric to judge the amount of time that passes. It is anguish. Chemicals compound, galaxies churn, celestial bodies form, stars explode, light is absorbed by the crushing weight of a decillion suns, and the spherical bubble of myopic spacetime turns inside out. It begins anew, boiling in the icy froth of unbeing.

It just so happens that today, an unquantifiable measure of time across the varied instances of white hot somethingness landing on an arbitrary point in the glacial, austere crystal which attempts to contain the full-house poker hand known as Material and Metaphysical Reality, is the thirteenth restructuring and shuffling of subatomic particles since The Unbecoming. 

It was the end, and the beginning. The most stable time loop. Every single time a universe has an aneurysm, like a balloon inflated much too eagerly, the shards that snap off like buckshot chip away at the fractal walls inside the opaque glass containing it all. Remember that old chestnut, the crystal? It was not just a metaphor.

When the anterior worlds pierce the crystalline, foggy thicket of architectural entropy, everything unravels. Dominoes falling at imperceptible speed. It reforms in jagged spiraling patterns before one recognizes anything was out of place.

Let’s take a closer look at the nitty-gritty, shall we? Here. This is a good place to start. Somewhere completely random. A simple cosmic cyst with no outwardly unique characteristics. It is almost exquisite in its blandness. As if one laid every world that ever has and ever will exist atop the others, extruded only the average among them, and dropped it into a petri dish to fester in ruthless, perfected mediocrity.

We can work with this.

There is nothing special about this day. It is one like any other for this time of year. The date is valueless. It is almost exquisite in its valuelessness.

The Midwestern region of the United States of America is camouflaged in musty indigo dusk. Boundless, amaranthine fields gleam in the moonlight, barren. Plucked clean during the harvest, with the exception of one. It sags in grief. Dying stalks absorb the moon’s reflective beams like a black hole. Vegetation postured like soldiers, poised to attack the ranch behind the dehydrated field. In this rickety old home, a young woman stands in her bedroom. She does not yet know this day is so completely pedestrian, so utterly drab that it could subsume any object with even the most microscopically fascinating attribute into the bleak, soporific rational kernel at the very heart of this shitty fucking universe.

Uh… what was her name?

Your name is RUBY BENNETT. Deep within the plains of the flat, dull countryside, resides your quaint little FARMHOUSE, built by your LATE FATHER when he was a mere boy. The seclusion from CIVIL SOCIETY allowed you the time to tinker with SOUND MANIPULATION as well as FRINGE POLITICAL THEORY, in exchange for a blow to your PEOPLE SKILLS. Fear not, however; your trusty OUTDATED DESKTOP COMPUTER, a parting gift from your dear old dad before getting MANGLED BY A COMBINE, gives you the opportunity for sweet, sweet SOCIAL INTERACTION. You often SURF THE NET with a HAND-ROLLED CIGARETTE in between your lips, or a THICK FRAGRANT CIGAR on special occasions. The habit has stained most of your clothing and possessions with the stink of tar, especially your EXPANSIVE WARDROBE OF BERETS AND SWEATERS.

Lately, you have taken a liking to the NOVELTY PLUSH ANIMALS known as BEADY BABIES produced by the Kry Corporation. The most valuable BEADY BABIES in your vast collection will stay stuck behind their designated plexiglass cubes for all of eternity. Trapped in the closet, relegated to the completely arbitrary weals and whims of the RAPIDLY-CHANGING PLUSHIE ECONOMY composed of, almost exclusively, FIFTY- TO SIXTY-YEAR OLD WOMEN and REPULSIVE SCALPERS. Similarly, your deep love for PHYSICAL MUSIC RELEASES has financially drained you. Garish and elaborate SPECIAL EDITION PACKAGING casts shadows over you. Signed 4xCD compilations in white plastic amaray cases. 7xLP box sets with elaborate embossed gold leaf artwork. 20 cassette tapes encased within a miniature replica of the BOOK DEPOSITORY that WAR HERO LEE HARVEY OSWALD was holed up in during the events of NOSCOPE-ASSASSINATED PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY’s motorcade parade in Dallas, TX. This type of music and medium of release was introduced to you by A VERY GOOD ONLINE FRIEND OF YOURS who has dedicated much of her life to HARSH UNCOMPROMISING ART.

Golden stalks of CORN surround your rickety abode. The final harvest of the season, and POPS isn't alive to cut, thresh, and clean the grain crops as he would every year. You wonder what will happen to the FLOURISHING AMBER GRASSES with no one to cull them. Images of GREY TOPSOIL and DECAYING FLORA flash into your eyes. Wretched thought. Put it out immediately. Tap your palm against the side of your head and let it fall out of your ear. Stamp your heel onto the intrusion as it wriggles like an eel on the ground with the DUSTY PEANUT SHELLS and ANCIENT BEER CANS. There is no use in such ideas. You were taught there is no one more foolish than the man without OPTIMISM, though it feels like the internalization of your father’s GLASS-HALF-FULL LIFESTYLE has started to gently fade away.

What will you do?

# **>Ruby: Retrieve arms from cigarette carton.**

![cig_box.png](/img/user/Meta/attachments/cig_box.png)

You haven't stored your ARMS in there since you started SMOKING. It was fairly cramped anyway. Perfect for storing CIGARETTES, however!

# **>Ruby: Retrieve cigarettes from cigarette carton, WISEASS!**

![0002.png](/img/user/Meta/attachments/0002.png)

You don't think you appreciate that tone!

# **>Ruby: That was a lot. Smoke a rollie to chill out.**

As great as that sounds, it seems like it might be a poor idea to smoke indoors. Maybe you could crack a window?


# **>Ruby: Crack a window and smoke.**
![RUBYS_WINDOW.png](/img/user/Meta/attachments/RUBYS_WINDOW.png)
It is 4 AM and the moon grimaces out of your view. You pull the thick cancerous smog into your lungs, holding it deep within the pit of your chest. Chilled rural air takes its place as you exhale.

The corn mocks you. Expansive death. There's barely an end to it. The stalks reach far into the horizon, swaying with the gentle winds. You imagine yourself as a child again. Lost in a maze. Left to meander for hours. You clawed and hacked and pushed through the husks until you somehow reached a misshapen blank spot in the fertile acreage, the soil comparatively much older, more dead. Almost as soon as you found it, Pops emerged from the other end of the space to scold you for wandering too far. His voice boomed with concern more than anything else, but it still made you flinch and recede behind your arms as he scooped you into his. The prickle of his greying mustache pressed onto your forehead when you told him how peculiar it was that there was nothing growing there. You offered to plant some seeds there. He told you that it was no use, and the grown-ups were handling it since before you could speak.

It couldn't be crop circles. You researched those extensively in middle school after an ex-friend's older brother told you that it sounded like "some alien shit, man." He reeked of herb and spirit, his room made you feel woozy. Aliens, supposedly, wrote in strange languages by flattening specific areas to form symbols with no equivalents in human language. However, the bare patch wasn't caused by the flattened crops; nothing was growing at all. No effort had been seemingly made to plant anything for years.

At thirteen years old, you went back, determined to plant something. Anything. The mystery of why this particular section was always so perfectly outlined and avoided could never be itched properly until you tried. Fingers prodding and sinking into the rough, dry dirt created just enough space to dump a handful of various seeds into the crevice. You had just watched the Tomacco episode of The Simpsons. Maybe this is special land. Maybe you'd hit literal pay dirt and Pops would take you somewhere far away from here. The big city, or maybe something a little quieter, a little more humble. You'd return to the patch often, memorizing the directions that once led you astray, bringing a cup of sink water to dump on where you'd not-so-subtly marked where the seeds where buried. Pops confronted you after seeing the X carved into the ground, but it's all empty in that part of your mind. His fist raps against your bedroom door four times. It fades after he steps inside. It only comes back when you start feeling hot tears stain your cheeks the same way they did seven years ago.

Pops was different after that. Strict. Midnight snacks became 9 PM stealth missions. Sleepovers were now forbidden at the Bennett Ranch. Homework was to be done in the living room while Antiques Roadshow came in half-clear on the television. You still don't understand what changed. You disobeyed plenty of times before. You were a moody kid, some of those disciplinary spankings were well-deserved. But none of them rippled out like this, never rippled to the point of shouting matches on the lawn, or threats of brake-cutting. You said you'd crush his kneecaps in his sleep with a sledgehammer. You stole his truck to drink shitty corn liquor with preppy kids. You brought up Mama, but only when you really wanted to hurt him. It was cruel and vindictive, but it didn't matter to you. You had something to look forward to, something to nourish and call yours, and he stomped on it with his work boots. It was only worth hoping for if it benefitted him, too. You got the half of the glass filled with air.

Your eyes focus back into view, on the dead grass. Don't look at the corn. You raise your cigarette to your lips again, even though it's mostly filter at this point, inhale, and toss it outside. You slam the window shut and lock it.


# **>Ruby: What a terrible idea that was. Switch to your green beret instead.**
![0003.png](/img/user/Meta/attachments/0003.png)
It's worth a shot. Anything to get your mind away from the suffocating past.

You don the green beret, the one reserved for nights out. It doesn't feel right. You feel vibrant, welcoming. The hat gleams with cordial energy. Who is it showing hospitality to? You quickly switch back.


# **>Ruby: Peruse cassette tapes.**
![YOU_HAVE_A_MOTHERFUCKING_MESSAGE_BIIIITCH.gif](/img/user/Meta/attachments/YOU_HAVE_A_MOTHERFUCKING_MESSAGE_BIIIITCH.gif)
Now *that* is a damn fine idea. You've always been prideful of your modest yet high quality collection.

There's actually a few tapes on your desk right now, a few you promised to record audio onto. You should probably tuck those away while they're not being use—OH FUCK.

Seriously? At this hour?

# **>Ruby: Eat chum.**

Your stomach rumbles at the thought of gnashing and swallowing and gorging yourself on chum. But, you can't do that with the ruckus of Pesterchum notifications clogging up your mind!

# **>Ruby: Treat desktop like a darling lover and check Pesterchum.**
![0004.png](/img/user/Meta/attachments/0004.png)
You lean over and give your monitor a smooch. Thank god for no-stain lipstick.

Who else could possibly be up this late?

Oh god damn it. She probably can't sleep, and now it's your problem. You suppose it wouldn't hurt to provide at least a few words of comfort.

# **>Ruby: Check message.**

# **>Ruby: Treat desktop like a sugar daddy and check your wantlist.**
![ruby_desktop_wantlist.png](/img/user/Meta/attachments/ruby_desktop_wantlist.png)
Tragically, your computer is not capable of printing money. But, it can certainly open the text document containing a list of some long sold-out and limited cassette titles you've been attempting to find through forum scouring and marketplace low-balling.
