## Backstory
I first met Phoebe on the HSOD, we became friends 15/09/25. Did not DM again until 24/09, where we talked about inspector scary. Then on the 3rd and 5th of October.

Then on the 26th i sent her lifewasters bc it released (WHICH SHE DIDNT WATCH....)

we had a nice chat about depression and i told her that i started reading the epilogues 

The first, second, and third time she said "sorry" to me.

### tarot reading

phoebe reading 24/12/25 

**(R) Six of wands** 
6 of wands is the minor arcana counterpart to The Chariot and thus shares its energy both relate to victory, pride, achievement, recognition, feelings of self importance, acknowledgement. In reversal means this energy is blocked, you have nothing to feel pride in. You are waiting for your day in the sun. 

**Page of Swords** 
*Use your Mind, Be Truthful, Be Just, Have Fortitude*

She is presenting you with a challenge, an opportunity for growth. Whether you like it or not. The situation you find yourself in will be uncomfortable, you must reexamine beliefs, face problems squarely, expose what is hidden, do what you know is right. The youthful energy of the page also contradicts the logic of swords. youth is sometimes naive and frustrating to reason with, this can lead to anguish. 

**(R??) Five of Wands** 

this one came out sideways, so it could be either reversed or normal. 
This card is one of conflict, competition or discourse or minor setbacks. These things annoy and frustrate endlessly. You are out of sorts and your enviroment is hostile. Sometimes the action can be inspiring, but competition is divisive by nature. Feeling like you have to outdo everyone, including yourself, is blocking the satisfaction of the Six of Wands/Chariot. I believe the Page of Swords is extending you a hand through this chaos. There is a path, there is value to be gained. You can analyze the situation, while pushing forward onto new horizons with a child like wonder 

**Temperance** 
Ahh this card always appears to me in my craziest moments. Temperance is balance, between you and your enviroment, between excess and abstenince. Falling into extremes can be helpful, especially for analysis, but recovering and offsetting these extremes is how you walk the path forward. Temperance is your own to experience. You can't make it happen for other people. The argumentative energy of the Five of Wands is fading, you are consolodating your experiences and reaching a synthesis point. 

**(R) The Chariot** 

But it still feels like you can't push through, you arent winning, you have no right to acclaim or victory. This is how it feels when you're stuck on a cart that isn't moving. You have no control over your enviroment. The stagnation is too much, its uncomfortable and its dissapointing and affects your ego, identity, self worth. Basically this card signifies you have lost control of the wheel and no longer care if you reach the finish line. 

**Knight of Wands** 
Through the helping hand of the Page of Swords, the harmony of Temperance, a step forward emerges with the Knight of Wands. You have skipped straight through the heartache of the 7-10 of wands. You had all the pieces with nowhere to put them, felt frustrated and stopped playing. The knight is more mature than the page, but not wise like the queen or king. She is daring, restless, passionate, hot tempered. She is not afraid to try new things, can act rash, she is very sure in herself and can get in trouble for running her mouth.. 

What i believe the spread is saying overall is: 

Barren wasteland. No glory. Only your mind. How do you find balance in the desert with no water? Where do you fill your cup? 
Use your mind to your advantage, question YOURSELF and find an answer. Bring this new concept into balance with what you already have. If you are stuck on the cart, now you realise you can leap off and venture your own path. This freedom can lead to imbalance of course, remember Temperance in all things. The good and the bad, they all have something to offer. But remember you have all the pieces you need already, If they don't fit it's time to search anew, for places you may occasionally place them down. This reading is overall positive, but stuck in the mud. 
There are forces working in your favour and forces working against. Remember that you are not just critic, but the artist as well. 
Change your enviroment accordingly to keep it in balance.
